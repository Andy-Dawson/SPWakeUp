# SPWakeUp (SPWakeUp3)

SPWakeUp - Wake up your Sharepoint and WSS Sites

A simple command line application that touches each site collection and sub-site on a Sharepoint or WSS front-end server to rebuild the IIS cache.

**Note:** The original code is not mine, I'm providing this for those people still wanting to use SPWakeUp.

This project was originally hosted at Codeplex. The archive is hosted at https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=spwakeup, the original source code for each release is also avaialble within the archive file that can be downloaded from that location.

SPWakeUp was originally provided for SharePoint 2007. It was also made available for SharePoint 2010. I provided builds for SharePoint 2013 and 2016. I have used SPWakeUp numerous times and found it to be a simple and reliable solution to wake up a SharePoint on-premises farm before users start accessing it for the day.

If you wish to compile SPWakeUp3 yourself, please follow the information in (build-it-yourself.md).
